Space invaders game using python turtle window
SPACE INVADER GAME
WORKING:
This is a virtual space invader game in which user is defending his space using his virtual space craft. User defends space by firing at enemy space crafts and increases score. If enemy space craft fires at user’s spacecraft, life will be deducted and if enemy crosses border line even then life will be deducted or invader crashes with player’s craft. And when life is 0 the game is overed and your final score will be displayed.
Following will be used to create this game:
•	Arrays or Lists
•	Objects and Classes
•	Conditional and Repetitional structures
•	Turtle
•	Tkinter
•	Winsound, Random and OS libraries 
PSEUDOCODE:
•	This game will be made using the Turtle Window.
•	Classes and Objects will be used.
•	We will create a class and assign the attributes of Turtle for making the boundaries of game.
•	A list or array will be used to store the coordinates of the boundaries, enemies and players will not be allowed to cross those boundaries so the game is played in a fixed place.
•	We will make another class to introduce player and define objects to link its movement and fire with keyboard.
•	Similarly, we will introduce enemies and extra scores using classes.
•	Tkinter will be used to add buttons to the game. 

LANGUAGE:
For this project I will be using Python language and IDLE (3.9) interpreter.
